To build and run the project:

1. Save the C++ code as `main.cpp` and the CMakeLists.txt in the same directory.
2. Create a build directory and navigate to it:
   ```
   mkdir build && cd build
   ```
3. Run CMake:
   ```
   cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/libtorch ..
   ```
4. Build the project:
   ```
   cmake --build . --config Release
   ```
5. Run the executable:
   ```
   ./torch_square_operations
   ```

This implementation maintains the Strategy pattern and provides similar functionality to the Python version, including GPU acceleration and basic profiling. The main differences are in the syntax and some C++-specific constructs like `std::unique_ptr` for memory management.

To add a new squaring method, you would follow the same process as before:

1. Create a new class that inherits from `Square`.
2. Implement the `square` and `name` methods.
3. Add an instance of your new class to the `strategies` vector in `main()`.

This version should provide performance characteristics very similar to the Python version, as it's using the same underlying library (PyTorch/LibTorch).
